{"name":"Lubuntu/L4","tagline":"Running Lubuntu on top of L4 micro kernel","body":"### Welcome to Lubuntu/L4 project.\r\n\r\nMy ambition is running a secure OS in my daily life. L4 micro kernel is awesome but until now we have no real applications run on it (I may guess that someone is really running it for private purpose, who know ?, maybe some governments or NSA ;) )\r\n\r\nI'm interesting the idea of micro kernel when I have the Operating System course at the university. I saw a candidate, Minix3, the ancestor of the great OS, Linux. I used Minix3 for a while, I also ported netcat and a network driver to Minix3. I don't really understand Minix3, but I think that Minix3 is just for research purpose, or other words, just my opinion, Minix3 is not suitable for being real OS cause by it's performances and the quantity of its implementation.\r\n\r\nAfter, I found L4 series kernel, Fiasco.CO and others, and then Genode framework. I have strong believe that Genode is going the right way for making a real micro operating system. But we have one problem, Genode-lab is a company and they have some other objectives about money than just fun and pleasure when we doing great things. So that why this project is create, for the purpose of an OS for the community which was build for fun and pleasure by doing great thing!\r\n\r\nIn the first stage of this project, I strong believe that I have to build a strong community who really love doing this. And for doing that, we have to reach a result when everyone who may love this project can see how the OS works in real daily life. What why the first stage of project is only running Lubuntu on top of Genode framework. Although we have no more secure than traditional Linux OS in this stage but this is a very important step for further steps! I think you know what I mean.\r\n\r\nSo, for anyone who wish to create a new generator of operating system, really change the foundation of any computer, LET'S JOIN US!.\r\n\r\n### Contacts\r\nIRC: lubuntu-l4\r\nMail list: ....\r\n ","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
